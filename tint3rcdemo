# single bracket blocks, like the following, denote individual named blocks on the bar
#
# [name]
#   id (identifier)
#   forground (hex value)
#   background (hex value)
#   (extra information)
#
# where an id can be any of the following:
#  graph:
#    standard bar graph, only works with sakamoto-font
#    so far only works on networks
#  scale:
#    graduated background, slowly fading from forground
#    to background based on a 0-100 scale. only supports
#    raw number streame
#
# time:
#   a clock, requires a format string
#
# workspaces:
#  workspace tracker, requires color
#  further configuration can be achieved
#  through a recompilation of the bar
#
# text:
#  raw text
#
#
#forground and background are both required for ALL blocks, and must be given a 6 digit hex string
#
#some blocks have other information, such as source, type, and format strings
#
