tint3
===============
tint3 is not a fork of tint2.
tint3 does not use any code from tint2.
tint3 is not (for now) backwards compatible with tint2.
tint2 appears to be a dead project, has an unmaintainable codebase, and has strayed from it's original goal of being lightweight. 

*much of the code wrapping X is pulled from the suckless tools, namely dmenu
*like many of the suckless tools, tint3 is configured with header files. I eventually hope to write a parser from tint2rc to tint3/config.h.

**tint3 uses feature branches. If you would like to submit a PR, submit it on a feature branch. all external PR's to master will be closed.

tint3 is licensed under the GPLv2 (I just havent added the license file yet)
